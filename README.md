# rubbleapp
Project name: Rubblink

What it does:

Organizations or residents in Gaza can report areas of rubble by sending us images and locations through our application, or through SMS or WhatsApp messages.
An AI system will then scan these images, automatically sort its contents based on material type likelihood, as well as estimated percentage and quality, and store each material in a digital warehouse.
Finally, construction and humanitarian organisations will have access to a marked map, and this warehouse, to find areas of rubble, remove them, and use the estimated materials reported to rebuild.
